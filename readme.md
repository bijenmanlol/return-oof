# RETURN THE ROBLOX OOF SOUND

## Support discontinued and no longer working

Since some time ago roblox removed the well known oof sound.
This update is not liked by the player community.

I made this program to automatically return the oof sound.

This program is entirely written in batch and is only available on windows.

It cannot be used if roblox was downloaded from the Microsoft Store

When downloaded simply run the Installer.bat to install the program.

If you change your mind run the Un-Installer.bat to remove the program.
